# CodeClause_Sentiment_analysis

[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)<br>

## What It Does:
Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. This is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service or idea.


1️⃣ Data Collection <br>
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing <br>
3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis <br>
4️⃣ Dataset Balancing & Scaling <br>
5️⃣ Machine Learning Models Training & Evaluation

## Prerequisites:
I would highly recommend that before the hack night, you should have some kind of toolchain and development environment already installed and ready. If you have no idea where to start with this, try a combination like: <br>


1️⃣ `Python`<br>
2️⃣ `nltk`<br>
3️⃣ `Pandas`<br>
4️⃣ `NumPy`<br>
5️⃣ `Matplotlib`<br>
6️⃣ An environment to work in - something like `Jupyter` or `colab`<br>

For Linux people, your package manager should be able to handle all of this. If it somehow can't, see if you can at least install Python and pip and then use pip to install the above packages.

## Dataset:

> You can collect raw dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset).

## Machine Learning Model:

1️⃣**Naive bayes**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Naïve Bayes classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which is used for classification tasks, like text classification. It is also part of a family of generative learning algorithms, meaning that it seeks to model the distribution of inputs of a given class or category


2️⃣**Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) is a handy algorithm that uses the frequency of words to determine how relevant those words are to a given document. It's a relatively simple but intuitive approach to weighting words, allowing it to act as a great jumping off point for a variety of tasks.


3️⃣ **Multinomial NB[Naive Bayes]**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The algorithm is based on the Bayes theorem and predicts the tag of a text such as a piece of email or newspaper article.


4️⃣ **Linear SVC[Linear Support Vector Machine]**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of a Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier) is to fit to the data you provide, returning a "best fit" hyperplane that divides, or categorizes, your data. From there, after getting the hyperplane, you can then feed some features to your classifier to see what the "predicted" class is.


5️⃣ **Logistic regression**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables.
